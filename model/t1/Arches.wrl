NavigationInfo { type [ "EXAMINE" "ANY" ] } ###  Default X3D NavigationInfo

# First, an Arch is created in a group. The Arch includes of left and right columns, each positioned using a Transform group and its translation field.
# Next, each Arch group includes a horizontal box spanning the two columns. The box is translated up to the top of the columns using a Transform group node.
# The angled top of each Arch is created using two boxes, each rotated about the Z axis to tilt them. A translation then positions the tilted boxes at the top of the archway.
# Next, the entire Arch group is instanced multiple times, rotating each instance to create a circle of archs forming a gazeebo-like structure.
# Finally a base for the structure is added.
